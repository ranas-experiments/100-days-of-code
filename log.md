# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 28th, 2025
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Installed Xubuntu on a virtual machine.

**Thoughts:** Quite excited to start this!


### Day 0: August 3rd, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to navigate, create, move and delete files using the CLI.

**Thoughts**: This is new and a little tough. But feels very cool and I hope useful.



### Day 1: August 5th

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through TOP's HTML foundations.

### Day 2: August 6th, 2025

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed the HTML boilerplate.

### Day 3: August 7th

**Today's Progress**: I learned about nesting lists and different attributes that they can get, different types of markup, and reviewed linking to other webpages.

**Thoughts**: I feel that I'm moving a bit slow. But reading and following along all these resources takes time. I am practicing though, that's a good thing I suppose. I have to practie typing better too.

### Day 4: August 8th

**Today's progress**: Reviewed using images and links, learned about root paths, SVG format, and different attributes of the a tag. Read about useful commits and a little on semanticc HTML.

**Thoughts**: Still feeling that I'm going nowhere. I need to push through and maybe read more preisely and thoroughly and deeply. And also practice, which TOP's will come tomorrow. So fingers crossed for that!
Also need to review how to use git and github. Will watch a video on that tomorrow.

### Day 5: August 9th

**Today's progress**: Just learned how to add an element to multiple lines in vs code which is SO COOL!!!
Practiced builing multiple pages. Learned some useful vs code shortcuts. Practiced git and published my work on github.

**Thoughts**: Didn't learn any new html today and I'm somewhat worried that I'm losing oppurtunities to learn. I'm gonna read MDN pages more carefully and practice using more elements. But it was really fun today and thr vsc trick really gave me a pump! Also this re-learning how to type thing is somewhat challenging.

### Day 6: August 10th

**Today's Progress**: Just reviewed the basic syntax for css and practiced using classes and IDs.

**Thoughts**: I feel frustrsted with css. It scares me more than it should. and I'm afraid if this is how I feel about the beginning of css, what will js bring?! BUT! that's not something to worry about for now. Judt focus on the now.

### Day 7: August 11th

**Today's progress**: Did Odin's css exercises.

**Thoughts**: CSS feels scary! Although the pratices were easy and I didn't struggle at all, but grasping the whole idea of the different kinds of selecting is a bit hard. Also typing is hard!

### Day 8: August 12th

**Today's progress**: Learned about specificity and the cascade. Did Odin's exercises.

**Thoughts**: It feels a bit icky. But I was able to do the practices right, so I get I have to see how stuff goes in real projects.

### Day 9: August 13th

**Today's progress**: Learned about Chrome's DevTools and practiced typing.

**Thoughts**: Ugh.

### Day 10: August 14th

**Today's progress**: Learned about css box model finally in detail and practiced typing.

**Thoughts**: I'm happy I've learned this. Gonna try and apply for the graphics design course tomorrow.

### Day 11: August 15th

**Today's progress**: Learned further about css box model in detail and practiced somethings. I also practiced typing.

**Thoughts**: It's reslly cool to learn about details of how these things work. There are so many variables and rules and that's both challenging and fun.

### Day 12: August 16th

**Today's progress**: practiced css.

### Day 13: August 17th

**Today's progress**: practiced styling a page with css. learned a tiny bit about flexbox.

**Thoughts**: seems like i've forgotten the things that i've learned; or maybe it's just not that much and is just the very basic things and that's why i don't think of it that much.

### Day 14: August 18th

**Today's progress**: learned the foundations of flexbox.

**Thoughts**: this seems really cool.

### Day 15: August 19th

**Today's progress**: practicced and learned a tiny bit more flexbox.

**Thoughts**: this is really cool!

### Day 16: August 20th

**Today's progress**: Learned about the flex property values: initial, auto and none. First time reading a -part of- W3C article.

**Thoughts**: a bit abstract, need practie.

### Day 17: August 21th

**Today's progress**: Practiced and learned a bunch about flexbox.

**Thoughts**: This is manageable, but needs more practice to really sink in.

### Day 18: August 22th

**Today's progress**: Learned about the flexbox:
<ul>
  <li>min-width=0 can fix the flex-shrink items overflowing when past their default min width.</li>
  <li>flex-basis is like width/height but it's pegged to the main axis. so when flex-direction=column, basis actually changes height.</li>
  <li>margin-left/right=auto <small>can also be done with nesting some items in another flexbox and using flex=1</small></li>
  <li>align-content</li>
  <li>border-radius=16px/50% creates circles</li>
</ul> 

### Day 19: August 23th

**Today's progress**: Did odin's flexbox exercises.

**Thoughts**: these were easy,...


### August 24-26th

**Today's progress**: <i>fell sick so wasn't able to do anything. but won't reset the timer 'cause i was sick!</i>


### Day 20: August 27th

**Today's progress**: Did the rest of odin's flexbox exercises.

**Thoughts**: these were frustrating! why does flexbox do these things?!
have to look into the things that I missed.

### Day 21: August 28th

**Today's progress**: Did odin's flexbox exercises. <br>In order to make a page fit the entire browser window size, height: 100vh can be used. 1vh=1% the height of the viewport. Also overflow: hidden prevents scrolling.<br>played with chatgpt for a while.

**Thoughts**: I get more and more confused with flex.<br>post-gpt, i'm feeling like i'm getting a hold of this...

### Day 22: August 29th

**Today's progress**: completed the end of odin's CSS foundations project. <br> Learned about transformation-duration which is super cool.

**Thoughts**: this was super fun.

### Day 23: August 30th

**Today's progress**: Started leasrning JavaScript. Just some basic introductions.

**Thoughts**: whoa.

### Day 24: August 31th

**Today's progress**: Got familiar with math used in JS.

**Thoughts**: hisashiburidane!

### Day 25: September 1st

**Today's progress**: more math.

### Day 26: September 2nd

**Today's progress**: Reviewd JS' very basics again.

**Thoughts**: This feels a but overwhelming.

### Day 27: September 3rd

**Today's progress**: Studied operators, conditionals, etc. Made my first if statement.

**Thoughts**: this feels a bit vague still. all of these rules and still very little to do.

### Day 28: September 4th

**Today's progress**: Did some basic practices.

**Thoughts**: feeling frustrated because i still don't know much of the syntax.

### Day 29: September 5th

**Today's progress**: finished the readings on conditionals and reviews some basics.

**Thoughts**: i don't know... this has gotten better but like yesterday, i still feel like i'm walking on a very shaky ground. things will get better, just like flexbox. but this time the scope is much wider-- thus more exciting! at least it will be when i get to actually do things and not just read...

### Day 30: September 6th

**Today's progress**: finished odin's first 5 js practices.

**Thoughts**: these were easier than the things i've been learning. I'm feeling overwhelmed and frustrated by js. So many things to learn and my brain feels frozen. also typing correctly is hard.

### Day 31: September 7th

**Today's progress**: Read about chrome webdev tools and went down a few CSS rabbit holes.

**Thoughts**: tired...

### Day 32: September 8th

**Today's progress**: Read more about chrome webdev tools and learned a tiny bit about functions!

**Thoughts**: this is just starting.

### Day 33: September 9th

**Today's progress**: Read about functions and tried to make a few.

**Thoughts**: everything is out of focus. my mind is jumping all over the place. To understand a sentence I have to read it at least twice.

### Day 34: September 10th

**Today's progress**: Finally finished MDN's articles on functions and learned some bits about arrays and event listeners. Made a few simple functions myself.

**Thoughts**: phew! now this is a bit more undestrandable. But also there's the whole logic behind the arrangement of things that i still kinda don't get, also it takes more time for the syntax to stick to my mind compared to HTML and CSS.

### Day 35: September 11th

**Today's progress**: read more on functions

### Day 36: September 16th

**Today's progress**: read more on functions

### Day 37: September 17th

**Today's progress**: practiced some bit.

**Thoughts**: it seems like there are many details (; for example) that escape from my eyes. and i feel like it will take forever for me to get a hold of this language.

### Day 38: September 18th

**Today's progress**: practiced the differences between function expressions and function declarations. did Odin's basic practices. read a tiny bit about the JS call stack and arrow functions.

**Thoughts**: well at least the exercises were a little soothing to see that i'm able to do some things. there aren't much real life examples and that makes grasping the concepts hard. also time flies by. my typing's gotten better but my brain is still mush.

### Day 39: September 19th

**Today's progress**: read some things on problem solving.

**Thoughts**: this part also is actually overwhelming because i feel like i don't know a thing about it. but i guess it's gonna come in handy for other things in life too. gotta keep pushing which is hard whith all of this work overload.

### Day 40: September 20th

**Today's progress**: read about commin js errors.

**Thoughts:** wow day 40! almost halfway there! (with just a few deviations :> ).

### Day 41: September 21th

**Today's progress**: started creating the rock paper scissors game.

**Thoughts**: which is super fun! gonna read about loops tomorrow so i can finish this one step ahead!

**Link to work:** https://github.com/ranas-experiments/rock-paper-scissors

### Day 42: September 28th

**Today's progress**: finished creating the rock paper scissors game!

**Thoughts**: it feels nice that after a one week gap (due to work overload) i still remember the things i've learned and i was even able to create a loop statement! i know now that my code could be so much shorter by using ${these kind of stuff} (embedding expressions using template literals) and i think it could be cleaner as well, but! one step at a time. i was able to make a mini console game all by myself and that's rad!

**Link to work:** https://ranas-experiments.github.io/rock-paper-scissors

### Day 43: September 30th

**Today's progress**: Read about clean code and loops. Made a few loops to go over items in an array.

### Day 44: Otober 1st

**Today's progress**: Read more on loops.

**Thoughts**: wow it's october already...

### Day 45: October 2nd

**Today's progress**: finally finished MDN's article on loops and did their playground exercises.

**Thoughts**: I'm feeling more confident and have been working on linking to actual items on a html page which is nice.

### Day 46: October 3rd

**Today's progress**: Read and exercised about manipulating the DOM. Started the creating a guest list project.

**Thoughts**: Very cool.

### Day 47: October 4th

**Today's progress**: Finished the project about the DOM and did the MDN loop practices. I also learned how to activate a button by clicking enter while in an input.

**Thoughts**: This feels like I'm actually able to do stuff with aaaalllll of those things that i read about. Feels very nice. My VM is starting to act weird though, getting all laggy from time to time. 

### Day 48: October 5th

**Today's progress**: Finished reading about loops.

### Day 49: October 7th

**Today's progress**: Started learning about arrays.

### Day 50: October 8th

**Today's progress**: Completed my function for sumInput using !(Number.isNaN(value)). Also learned about some array methods.

**Thoughts**: Feeling kinda nice! But the shrinking amount of time that I study is unpleasant for me.

### Day 51: October 11th

**Today's progress**: Continued reading on array methods.

**Thoughts**: This is really boring to me, the as when i was learning about string methods and such. Ugh i just wish this would end soon.

### Day 52: October 12th

**Today's progress**: Continued reading on array methods and practiced a bit.

**Thoughts**: Funny how one day's sleep can make a difference in how much I grasp a concept. Splice method seems so easier today compared to yesterday. Tomorrow I will do more practice and hopefuly end this method-reading suffering.
