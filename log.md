##### 

**Today's Progress**: Installed Xubuntu on a virtual machine.

**Thoughts:** Quite excited to start this!


### Day 0: August 3rd, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to navigate, create, move and delete files using the CLI.

**Thoughts**: This is new and a little tough. But feels very cool and I hope useful.



### Day 1: August 5th

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through TOP's HTML foundations.

### Day 2: August 6th, 2025

**Today's Progress**: I reviewed the HTML boilerplate.

### Day 3: August 7th

**Today's Progress**: I learned about nesting lists and different attributes that they can get, different types of markup, and reviewed linking to other webpages.

**Thoughts**: I feel that I'm moving a bit slow. But reading and following along all these resources takes time. I am practicing though, that's a good thing I suppose. I have to practie typing better too.

### Day 4: August 8th

**Today's progress**: Reviewed using images and links, learned about root paths, SVG format, and different attributes of the a tag. Read about useful commits and a little on semanticc HTML.

**Thoughts**: Still feeling that I'm going nowhere. I need to push through and maybe read more preisely and thoroughly and deeply. And also practice, which TOP's will come tomorrow. So fingers crossed for that!
Also need to review how to use git and github. Will watch a video on that tomorrow.

### Day 5: August 9th

**Today's progress**: Just learned how to add an element to multiple lines in vs code which is SO COOL!!!
Practiced builing multiple pages. Learned some useful vs code shortcuts. Practiced git and published my work on github.

**Thoughts**: Didn't learn any new html today and I'm somewhat worried that I'm losing oppurtunities to learn. I'm gonna read MDN pages more carefully and practice using more elements. But it was really fun today and thr vsc trick really gave me a pump! Also this re-learning how to type thing is somewhat challenging.

### Day 6: August 10th

**Today's Progress**: Just reviewed the basic syntax for css and practiced using classes and IDs.

**Thoughts**: I feel frustrsted with css. It scares me more than it should. and I'm afraid if this is how I feel about the beginning of css, what will js bring?! BUT! that's not something to worry about for now. Judt focus on the now.

### Day 8: August 12th

**Today's progress**: Learned about specificity and the cascade. Did Odin's exercises.

### Day 13: August 17th

**Today's progress**: practiced styling a page with css. learned a tiny bit about flexbox.

**Today's progress**: Practiced and learned a bunch about flexbox.

**Thoughts**: This is manageable, but needs more practice to really sink in.

### Day 18: August 22th

**Today's progress**: Learned about the flexbox:
<ul>
  <li>min-width=0 can fix the flex-shrink items overflowing when past their default min width.</li>
  <li>flex-basis is like width/height but it's pegged to the main axis. so when flex-direction=column, basis actually changes height.</li>
  <li>margin-left/right=auto <small>can also be done with nesting some items in another flexbox and using flex=1</small></li>
  <li>align-content</li>
  <li>border-radius=16px/50% creates circles</li>
</ul>
