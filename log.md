**Today's Progress**: Installed Xubuntu on a virtual machine.

**Thoughts:** Quite excited to start this!


### Day 0: August 3rd, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to navigate, create, move and delete files using the CLI.

**Thoughts**: This is new and a little tough. But feels very cool and I hope useful.

### Day 3: August 7th

**Today's Progress**: I learned about nesting lists and different attributes that they can get, different types of markup, and reviewed linking to other webpages.

**Thoughts**: I feel that I'm moving a bit slow. But reading and following along all these resources takes time. I am practicing though, that's a good thing I suppose. I have to practie typing better too.

### Day 4: August 8th

**Today's progress**: Reviewed using images and links, learned about root paths, SVG format, and different attributes of the <a> tag. Read about useful commits and a little on semanticc HTML.

**Thoughts**: Still feeling that I'm going nowhere. I need to push through and maybe read more preisely and thoroughly and deeply. And also practice, which TOP's will come tomorrow. So fingers crossed for that!
